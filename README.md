# Helper First Aid Application

## Application Outline:

Helper is a first aid application, designed to be easy to understand in order to allow for quick response in an emergency situation.
It is designed to allow people with little to no first aid experience to have a basic understanding of what to do if an accident occurs.
Helper also aims to allow users to quickly and easily find hospitals, in case of an emergency that requires urgent medical attention.
It navigates to Google Maps, so that users can find their way to these hospitals.
Helper allows users to contact emergency services from within the app.
Users can add their own emergency contact, in order to reach them more quickly in an emergency.

I believe that this would benefit society, as basic first aid before emergency respondents can attend to injured people can save lives.
